## üé® Design System

The CauldronOS platform follows "The Cauldron Way‚Ñ¢" design system:

### Core Principles

- **Intelligence First**: Every interface feels like an intelligent conversation
- **Motion with Meaning**: Animation enhances understanding, not distracts
- **Consistency and Coherence**: Unified experience across all interfaces
- **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: Design for all users, regardless of ability

### Technical Foundation

- Built with Ant Design, Ant Design X, and Ant Design Pro components
- Enhanced with Framer Motion for fluid animations and micro-interactions
- Supports dark mode and responsive design out of the box
- Uses TailwindCSS for styling with the `twMerge` utility
- AI-native components provide intelligent features and adaptability

## üß© Development Guidelines

- Use PNPM exclusively for dependency management
- Follow atomic design principles for UI components
- Use TailwindCSS for styling with the `twMerge` utility
- Ensure all components support dark mode and keyboard accessibility
- Use Zod for form validation
- Write strict TypeScript code with proper typing
- Follow the established directory structure
- Refer to the [usage-guide.md](./usage-guide.md) for UI development best practices

## üìö Documentation

- [design-system.json](./design-system.json) - Color tokens, spacing, typography, component variants
- [component-map.md](./component-map.md) - Old ‚û°Ô∏è New components list with replacement rationale
