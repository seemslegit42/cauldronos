# Component Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for gradually migrating existing components to the new UI system.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Core Components (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Button
- [ ] Input
- [ ] Select
- [ ] Checkbox
- [ ] Radio
- [ ] Switch
- [ ] Form

### Phase 2: Layout Components (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Card
- [ ] Modal
- [ ] Drawer
- [ ] Tabs
- [ ] Collapse
- [ ] Divider

### Phase 3: Data Display Components (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Table
- [ ] List
- [ ] Descriptions
- [ ] Tag
- [ ] Badge
- [ ] Avatar

### Phase 4: Navigation Components (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Menu
- [ ] Pagination
- [ ] Steps
- [ ] Breadcrumb
- [ ] Dropdown

### Phase 5: Feedback Components (Weeks 9-10)
- [ ] Alert
- [ ] Message
- [ ] Notification
- [ ] Progress
- [ ] Spin
- [ ] Result

### Phase 6: Specialized Components (Weeks 11-12)
- [ ] AI-specific components
- [ ] Dashboard widgets
- [ ] Admin panels
- [ ] Custom components

## Migration Approach

For each component, follow these steps:

1. **Create Enhanced Version**
   - Create the enhanced version of the component with cyberpunk styling
   - Ensure it maintains API compatibility with the original component
   - Add new features like animation support and variants

2. **Test in Isolation**
   - Test the enhanced component in isolation
   - Verify that it works correctly with all props and edge cases
   - Check accessibility and performance

3. **Create Migration Example**
   - Create an example showing how to migrate from the original to the enhanced component
   - Document any API differences or new features

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Update the component documentation with migration instructions
   - Add examples of the enhanced component in use

5. **Implement in Non-Critical Pages**
   - Start by implementing the enhanced component in non-critical pages
   - Monitor for any issues or bugs

6. **Gradually Expand Usage**
   - Once proven stable, expand usage to more pages
   - Consider using feature flags to toggle between old and new implementations

7. **Complete Migration**
   - Once all pages are using the enhanced component, remove the original implementation
   - Update all imports to use the new component

## Progress Tracking

| Component | Enhanced Version | Tests | Migration Example | Documentation | Implementation | Status |
|-----------|------------------|-------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Button    | ✅               | ✅    | ✅                | ✅            | Partial        | In Progress |
| Card      | ✅               | ✅    | ✅                | ✅            | Partial        | In Progress |
| Modal     | ✅               | ✅    | ✅                | ✅            | Partial        | In Progress |
| Input     | ✅               | ✅    | ✅                | ✅            | Partial        | In Progress |
| Form      | ✅               | ✅    | ✅                | ✅            | Partial        | In Progress |

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Breaking changes | High | Medium | Maintain API compatibility, provide clear migration guides |
| Performance issues | Medium | Low | Test performance before and after migration, optimize as needed |
| Inconsistent UI | Medium | Medium | Use design tokens consistently, create visual regression tests |
| Developer resistance | Medium | Medium | Provide clear benefits, good documentation, and support |
| Timeline slippage | Medium | Medium | Prioritize components, allow for flexible timeline |

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All components have been migrated to the new UI system
2. No regressions in functionality or performance
3. Improved developer experience with better type safety and reduced boilerplate
4. Consistent cyberpunk styling across the application
5. Positive feedback from users on the new UI
