# Cloud Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying CauldronOS to cloud environments.

## Prerequisites

- A Clerk account for authentication
- A database (PostgreSQL recommended)
- A cloud provider account (AWS, Azure, GCP, or Vercel)

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
# Clerk Authentication
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your-publishable-key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your-secret-key

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/cauldronos

# API
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# Storage
STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
STORAGE_REGION=us-west-2
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
STORAGE_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build the Application

```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy is using Vercel:

```bash
npx vercel
```

Follow the prompts to complete the deployment.

### 3. Deploy to AWS

To deploy to AWS:

1. Set up an S3 bucket for static hosting
2. Configure CloudFront for CDN
3. Set up API Gateway and Lambda for backend services
4. Configure RDS for database

### 4. Deploy to Azure

To deploy to Azure:

1. Set up Azure Static Web Apps
2. Configure Azure Functions for backend services
3. Set up Azure Database for PostgreSQL

### 5. Deploy to GCP

To deploy to GCP:

1. Set up Cloud Storage for static hosting
2. Configure Cloud CDN
3. Set up Cloud Functions or Cloud Run for backend services
4. Configure Cloud SQL for database

## Post-Deployment

After deployment, you'll need to:

1. Configure your DNS settings
2. Set up SSL certificates
3. Configure monitoring and alerts
4. Set up backup and disaster recovery

## Scaling Considerations

- Use a CDN for static assets
- Implement caching strategies
- Consider serverless functions for backend services
- Use database connection pooling
- Implement rate limiting and throttling
