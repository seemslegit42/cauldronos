# CauldronOS Modules

This directory contains all the pluggable modules for CauldronOS, similar to WordPress plugins. Each module is a self-contained application that provides specific functionality and can be installed, enabled, or disabled by users.

## Module Structure

Each module follows a standardized structure:

```
module-name/
├── api/                # Module-specific API endpoints
├── components/         # UI components
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── pages/              # Page components
├── store/              # State management
├── utils/              # Utility functions
├── index.ts            # Main entry point
├── manifest.json       # Module metadata and configuration
└── README.md           # Documentation
```

## Module Manifest

Each module must include a `manifest.json` file that defines its metadata and configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "Module Name",
  "slug": "module-slug",
  "description": "Module description",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "category": "category",
  "icon": "IconName",
  "requiredRoles": ["USER", "MANAGER", "ADMIN"],
  "isCore": false,
  "isPublic": true,
  "menuLabel": "Menu Label",
  "menuOrder": 10,
  "path": "/modules/module-slug",
  "defaultConfig": {},
  "permissions": [],
  "apiEndpoints": [],
  "dependencies": [],
  "routes": []
}
```

## Available Modules

### CRM

Customer Relationship Management module for managing contacts, leads, and deals.

### Analytics

Analytics and reporting module for tracking user activity and business metrics.

### Knowledge Base

Knowledge base and documentation module for creating and managing internal documentation.

### Calendar

Calendar and scheduling module for managing events and appointments.

### Email

Email marketing module for creating and sending email campaigns.

### AI Assistant

## Creating a New Module

To create a new module, use the module creator tool:

```bash
pnpm create:module my-module
```

This will create a new module with the standard structure and boilerplate code.

## Module Registration

Modules are automatically registered when they are installed. The module registration process is handled by the ModuleRegistry, which scans the modules directory and loads the modules based on their manifest files.

## Module API

Modules can expose API endpoints that can be accessed by other modules or external applications. API endpoints are defined in the module's manifest file and implemented in the module's API directory.

## Module Permissions

Modules can define permissions that control access to their functionality. Permissions are defined in the module's manifest file and enforced by the platform's permission system.

## Module Dependencies

Modules can depend on other modules. Dependencies are defined in the module's manifest file and enforced by the platform's module system.

## Module Configuration

Modules can be configured by users through the module's settings page. Configuration options are defined in the module's manifest file and implemented in the module's settings component.

## Module Lifecycle

Modules go through the following lifecycle:

1. **Installation**: The module is installed and registered with the platform.
2. **Initialization**: The module is initialized and its resources are loaded.
3. **Activation**: The module is activated and its functionality is available to users.
4. **Deactivation**: The module is deactivated and its functionality is no longer available to users.
5. **Uninstallation**: The module is uninstalled and its resources are removed.

## Module Development Guidelines

1. **Modularity**: Each module should be self-contained and not depend on other modules unless necessary.
2. **Standardization**: Follow the established patterns and structures for consistency.
3. **Documentation**: Each module should include comprehensive documentation.
4. **Testing**: Include tests for all functionality.
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure all UI components are accessible.
6. **Performance**: Optimize for performance, especially for modules that handle large amounts of data.
7. **Security**: Follow security best practices, especially for modules that handle sensitive data.
8. **Internationalization**: Support multiple languages through the platform's internationalization system.
9. **Theming**: Support the platform's theming system for consistent visual appearance.
10. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all UI components work well on all screen sizes.
