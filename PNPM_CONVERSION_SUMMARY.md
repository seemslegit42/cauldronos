# PNPM Conversion Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Root Configuration Files**:
   - Created a root `package.json` with workspace scripts
   - Created a root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to define the workspace structure
   - Added `.npmrc` with pnpm-specific configurations

2. **Conversion Scripts**:
   - Created `convert-to-pnpm.ps1` for Windows users
   - Created `convert-to-pnpm.sh` for Linux/macOS users
   - These scripts remove npm/yarn lock files and install dependencies using pnpm

3. **Documentation**:
   - Added `PNPM_USAGE.md` with detailed instructions on using pnpm in this project

4. **Dependency Management**:
   - Removed existing npm/yarn lock files
   - Generated pnpm lock files for the project

## Current Status

The project now uses pnpm as its package manager:

- Root workspace configuration is in place
- All subprojects (app, blog, e2e-tests) are part of the pnpm workspace
- Dependencies are installed using pnpm

## Next Steps

1. **Update CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Ensure CI/CD pipelines use pnpm instead of npm/yarn
   - Update any build scripts that might reference npm or yarn

2. **Team Onboarding**:
   - Share the `PNPM_USAGE.md` documentation with the team
   - Ensure all team members have pnpm installed

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Use pnpm for all future dependency installations
   - Run `pnpm install` after pulling changes that modify dependencies

## Notes

- There were some installation issues with `esbuild` and `canvas` packages, which might need to be addressed separately
- The app directory was already using pnpm, so minimal changes were needed there
